# Email-Campaign-AB_Testing-Project
This project analyzes an A/B test on email campaigns to determine whether a new landing page (treatment) improves the conversion rate compared to the old landing page (control). The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation to make data-driven recommendations.
